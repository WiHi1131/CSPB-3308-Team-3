#### Food Lookup Feature

##### Progress:

###### Initial Setup & Integration with Flask:
- Successfully set up a Flask development framework for the Food Lookup Feature.
- Created a dedicated route for the food tracking page.

###### UI Design & Implementation:
- Designed a basic layout with an input field using `foodlookup.html`.
- Styled the page for a user-friendly experience.

###### Version Control:
- Created a `food_lookup` branch for feature-specific development.

###### Documentation:
- Documented the purpose and features of the `food_lookup.py` in code comments within the python file, to be referenced for later documentation.

##### Next Steps:

###### Set Up MySQL Connection with Flask:
- Establish a MySQL database for the project, which will store foods and their nutritional values.
- Connect the Flask app to this MySQL database using the Flask-MySQL extension.

###### Auto-populate to Relational Database:
- Implement functionality to detect user input in real-time in the food input field.
- Create backend logic to fetch matching food names based on user input and display them as suggestions.

##### Challenges/Blockers:
- The main challenge anticipated for the upcoming week is ensuring a smooth connection between Flask and MySQL, especially considering potential server and database configurations that might need adjustments.
- Constructing the database correctly that can/will be accessed by other team members will require good collaboration on the part of the team.
- Implementing the auto-populate feature requires synchronization between frontend and backend, ensuring efficient and relevant suggestions without overloading the database with frequent queries.
